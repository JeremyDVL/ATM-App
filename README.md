An ATM app for depositing and withdrawing money.

## <ins>How to Run

Clone Repo into editor => Open terminal in VS Code or other editor => run "npx http-server" for live server

Pop up messages to alert use when they are overdrawn.  Some conditional formatting based on events for instance when total balance is zero turn zero red.  Animation for different actions would be nice to show money going in or going out.  Choosing denominations and error handling based on the balance.  Some quick cash options.
